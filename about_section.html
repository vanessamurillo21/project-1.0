            like birthdays, annivesaries, holidays evenutally turned into something we wanted 
            devout our attention too. As any business, trial and error was and is something we 
            often face but it allows to grow. We believe that our gifts we given to us by God 
            and we seek to honor him with this blessings we recieved. All glory always belongs to Him
            and we are always forever thankful for enabling us to be where we are at today. We love 
            putting a smile on the faces of our customers and bringing their ideas to life which
            allows them to express the unique style they seek to express. We understand the importance
            of durability and longevity in jewelry so we prioritize having tarnish-resistance materials.
